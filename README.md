# nextjs-datafetch

A simple CRUD application that uses [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) for static site generation and [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for data. Written on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io). The CRUD actions are a bit janky, because no data is being stored in the database.
